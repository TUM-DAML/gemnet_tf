# GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules

Reference implementation in TensorFlow 2 of the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet). You can find its [PyTorch implementation in another repository](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/gemnet_pytorch). GemNet is a model for predicting the overall energy and the forces acting on the atoms of a molecule. It was proposed in the paper:

**[GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/gemnet/)**   
by Johannes Klicpera, Florian Becker, Stephan GÃ¼nnemann   
Published at NeurIPS 2021.

## Run the code
Adjust config.yaml (or config_seml.yaml) to your needs.
This repository contains notebooks for training the model (`train.ipynb`) and for generating predictions on a molecule loaded from [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (`predict.ipynb`). It also contains a script for training the model on a cluster with Sacred and [SEML](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/seml) (`train_seml.py`). Further, a notebook is provided to show how GemNet can be used for MD simulations (ase_example.ipynb).

## Compute scaling factors
You can either use the precomputed scaling_factors (in scaling_factors.json) or compute them yourself by running fit_scaling.py. Scaling factors are used to ensure a consistent scale of activations at initialization. They are the same for all GemNet variants.

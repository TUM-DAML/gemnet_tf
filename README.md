# GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules

Reference implementation in TensorFlow of the GemNet model proposed in the paper:

**[GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/gemnet/)**   
by Johannes Klicpera, Florian Becker, Stephan GÃ¼nnemann   
Published at NeurIPS 2021.

## Run the code
Adjust the config.yaml and config_seml.yaml file to your needs.
This repository contains a notebook for training the model (`train.ipynb`) and for generating predictions on a molecule loaded from ase (`predict.ipynb`). It also contains a script for training the model on a cluster with Sacred and [SEML](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/seml) (`train_seml.py`).

## Derive scaling factors
You can either use the precomputed scaling_factors (in scaling_factors.json) or derive them yourself by running fit_scaling.py. Scaling factors are the same for all GemNet variants.
